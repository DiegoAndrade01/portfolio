# Projetos


## [Projeto 1: Recursos Humanos - Recrutamento interno](https://github.com/DiegoAndradeDS/Projects/tree/master/HR_promocao) 

Neste projeto criei um modelo de Machine Learning para identificar qual funcionário deverá receber uma promoção. Esse modelo visa substituir um processo seletivo para promoção dos funcionários visando melhorar a transição do funcionário entre os cargos e também reduzir o tempo necessário para avaliar a promoção.

## [Project 2: Análise de Vendas](https://github.com/DiegoAndradeDs/Projects/Vendas_Produtos_e_Representantes) 
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. 
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model. 
* Built a client facing API using flask

## [Project 2: Ball Image Classifier](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
